These scripts are used to start/stop cloud database servers, run tests and 
possibly other things. Generally they are safe to run without arguments
except for the run*.sh scripts which run ssh on each cloudsmall server
in turn.

The scripts manage two different networks: a local lxc container network
and a network of smaller servers all with names like cloudsmall1 (up to 5).
For the lxc containers the servers are: cassandra, riak, mongo & voldemort.
For the cloudsmalls: cassandra, riak, mongo, voldemort, hbase & mysql.
Mysql is only running on cloudsmall1 for comparison.

SCRIPTS TO MANAGE PROCESSES ON THE CLOUDSMALL* SERVERS:

startcs.sh - start a cloud database on all cloudsmall servers
stopcs.sh - stop a cloud db on all cloudsmall servers
runcs.sh - run an ssh process on every cloudsmall server in turn
speed_all.sh - run the lib/speed.py test for a specific server
               this script will take care of starting and stopping
               the servers.
               By default runs all tests for 10 iterations with all servers.
               Usage: speed_all.sh [iterations] [servers] [sleep time]

SCRIPTS TO MANAGE PROCESSES ON THE LXC CONTAINERS:

startlxc.sh - (runs via sudo) start a server 
runlxc.sh - (runs via sudo) like runcs.sh run a process on all containers
startjepsen.py - start jepsen tests for a given server. Unlike speed_all.sh,
                 the server must be started with startlxc.sh before the script
                 can be run.
                 Usage: startjepsen.py {server} [test] ['excludeall']
                 (the behaviour of 'excludeall' is to fully partition each lxc
                  container from the rest of the network)

                 to stop the jepsen server:
                 Ctrl-Z
                 killall python
                 fg

PROCESSING TEST RESULTS:

CSV output suitable for use in excel can be generated from any test.
The parse_speed.pl script can extract test info and stats from the 
jepsen and speed test outputs. Multiple files can be used as input.
First run the test and collect the output into a file. For example:

bash> bin/jepsen_run_dynamodb.py overwrite 2>&1 | tee public_html/results/20140812/jepsen_dynamo_overwrite.txt
...
bash> bin/parse_speed.pl public_html/results/20140812/jepsen_dynamo_overwrite.txt > public_html/results/20140812/jepsen_dynamo_overwrite.csv

MISC:

test - directory that contains some python cloud db test scripts
parse_speed.pl - used with the output of lib/speed.py to generate spreadsheet data
partition.sh - (not used) iptables script to partition lxc containers
jepsen_run_dynamodb.py - test an external amazon dynamodb instance see also lib/jepsen_dyanmodb.py

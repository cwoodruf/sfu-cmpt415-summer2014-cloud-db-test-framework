Some basic scripts to manage jepsen tests via the web.
Generally its a good idea to do this via the CLI on cloudbig
but for experimentation these are available.

JEPSEN TEST FRAMEWORK SCRIPTS:

These scripts are wrappers for the shell scripts in
bin/ which do all the hard work.

clear-testing.cgi - clears the results/TESTING lock file.
start-server.cgi - use this script first to start a server
                   needs a test={cassandra|mongo|riak|voldemort}
                   parameter.
start-test.cgi - runs a full group of tests for the given server
                 named in the test= parameter
status.cgi - AJAX script to get the ps -ef output

OTHER FILES:

index.php - script with links to start-server.cgi invocations.
            Use this as a first step to initiating a test.
results - viewable directory with result logs from various tests.
          Also has all the logs for the speed tests that cannot 
          be run from this interface.
